# Retail_store
* A program for a retail store that will allow them to calculate discounts for their employees when they buy items.
* Discounts are based on the number of years worked ($2 for each year, maximum $10) as well as if the employee is a manager ($10 more discount on top of the worked year discount) or hourly employee ($2 discount). 
* They are also allowed no discount once they have received $20 discount.
* The program starts asking for the employee discount number to start purchasing. 
* The employee can purchase 1 item at a time.
* Once all employees have been processed, give the users option to go back to Menu or Exit the program.
